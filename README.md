# Credit-Fraud-Detection
# Problem Synopsis
Large retail organisations face challenges when they move their business online. Some of these challenges include fraudulent mobile calls, fraudulent purchases and fraudulent credit card transactions. These challenges become difficult to analyze if organisations rely on traditional analytical approaches. The issues with traditional approaches include manual analytical processes to transform and analyze the data which takes enormous amount of time and also multiple verification methods are needed which causes inconvenience to the user. Detecting fraudulent transactions and anomalous activities in real time helps organisations to prevent frauds and save money.
